                As the saying goes, “Music is the reflection of self”, It connects to an individual on a personal level and helps them in bringing forth their intimate emotions and understanding it. One can clearly see their conscience reflected through the melody of words and help them understand their inner turmoil.
                Through the medium of song,people realize they are not the only one suffering and this creates a brotherhood of all the listeners going through the mental and emotional blockade across space and time and thus creating an unparalleled therapeutic experience.            </p>
